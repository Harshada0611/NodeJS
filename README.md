# Filtering
Category: Users can filter products by category, narrowing down the search results to specific types of items.

Brand: When a category is selected, relevant brands will be displayed for further filtering, enabling users to find products from specific brands within a selected category.

Price Range: Users can specify a price range to filter products within a certain budget. 
             For instance, they can filter products within ranges like 100 to 500 or 600 to 1000. 
             The available price range is from 10 to 2000, allowing users flexibility in their search.

Discount Range: Users can filter products by discount percentage, such as products with 10% or more discount. 
                The discount range available for filtering ranges from 2% to 20%.

# Sorting
Price: Users can sort products either from low to high or from high to low based on their price. This feature allows users to easily find products that match their budget preferences.

# Pagination
Pagination is implemented to enhance user experience by displaying 10 products per page. This prevents overwhelming users with too much information at once and provides a structured way to navigate through search results.
